// Read the input until you encounter the number 0.
// Then, output the biggest number (excluding the number 0)
// and the zero-based position where it appears.

// Example:
// Input: 1 3 5 0
// (1 is in position 0. 3 is in position 1. 5 is in position 2.)
// Output: 5 2
// (The biggest number is 5, which occurs in position 2.)
